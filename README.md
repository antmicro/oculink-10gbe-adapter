## Overview

This project includes PCB design files for an adapter card that integrates two 10GBASE-T (RJ45) PHYs, providing high-speed network connectivity. 
The host interface utilizes a PCI Express Gen3 x4 link, delivered via an OCuLink connector.
The PCB design files were prepared in KiCad 9.x.

## Key features

* Two RJ45 10G Ethernet ports
* OCuLink PCIe x4 connector
* Intel X710-AT2 Ethernet controller
* USB-C and DC Power connectors
* 70 x 100 mm (2.76 x 3.94 inch) PCB dimensions
